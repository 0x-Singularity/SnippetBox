# SnippetBox
Similar to pastebin, but a full stack web app built using Go

- The cmd directory will contain the application specific code for the executable applications in the project.

- The internal directory will contain the ancillary non-application-specific code used in the project. 

- The ui directory will contain the users-interface assets used by the web app.
